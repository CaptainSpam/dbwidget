# dbwidget

An Android home screen widget for Desert Bus For Hope.

This widget regularly fetches data from the VST and displays the current donation total, hours bussed, and dollar amount to the next hour, assuming the bus is rolling.  If not, it'll display either how much was raised in the most recent run or how much has been raised for the next run and how far away said run is, if we know.

1.2.0 introduces one single config option for turning on Rustproof Bee Shed banners (Beta Flight and Dusk Guard, replacing Alpha Flight and Night Watch, respectively).  If you had the widget placed on your home screen before, you'll need to remove it and re-add it if you want the Bee Shed banners.
