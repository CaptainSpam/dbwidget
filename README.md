# dbwidget

An Android home screen widget for Desert Bus For Hope.

This widget regularly fetches data from the VST and displays the current donation total, hours bussed, and dollar amount to the next hour, assuming the bus is rolling.  If not, it'll display either how much was raised in the most recent run or how much has been raised for the next run and how far away said run is, if we know.

This is designed to be very simple, and as such, has no real configuration options yet.  You just plop it on your home screen somewhere and let 'er rip.
